README: Generating Submission Forms

Pre-requirements
================
1. python Version >= 2.3
2. Install python package ConfigObject (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/configobj)
3. Install perl (list of package dependencies will be available soon) 
4. in invenio-local.conf set variable CFG_WEBSTYLE_TEMPLATE_SKIN = Institutes-name (i.e. CERN, DESY, GSI, FZJ,... . Same shortname has to be used in the configuration file "config.cfg"). If local variable not set, default(DESY) submission forms are created
5. After changes in local-conf do not forget "inveniocfg --update-all" :)
6. load DEMO-Documenttypes (because we have to clone some functionalities)
7. load Authorities (Publication Types, Authors, Institutes, Journals,.... ) (if no authorities loaded--> websubmit form should be displayed correct, but a real submission will run into an error!)


Create submit/modify forms
==========================
In command-line interface: 
	-cd $INVENIO-Installation/etc/websubmit/ 
	-python process_confobj.py -arg config.cfg (arguments= c:create, d:delete)
	--> all submit/modify forms are created depending on the configuration in config.cfg. So, before running process_confobj.py make sure your individual configurations are already in config.cfg

Configuration of config.cfg
===========================
It consists of the following main sections:

-SCHEMA defines the schema on the submission webpage.
-COLLECTION defines which doctypes belong to which submissionCollection.
-ORDER defines the field order in the forms (which field should be listed above/below of another) 
-DEFAULT_FORM sets common fields which appear 'quite' often in 		 documenttypes. Any other document_form which is defined under 'Institutional Configuration' will be checked against this default_form. It has the advantage, that we do not have to define the same fields for most of the documenttypes again. Instead we make only changes to the default_form to create new individual documenttypes.

	structure of the default form:
	[default_form]
	fieldname = description, "o/m" (optional/mandatory), "order(digit)" (set new field order)  
	hgf_start = Submission,o
	hgf_9201_a = Division / Group involved,m,10
	hgf_913__v = Large Scale Facility / Beamline,m,10000
	hgf_245__a = Title,m

-DEFAULT configuration 
-DESY configuration
	
	Example 1:
	in the default_form we have the field 
	hgf_920__l = Support by HGF-Employee,o
	
	in the DESY-form we want to do some changes:
	hgf_920__l = Support by DESY-Employee,m, 5000 
	-->We change the short description of the field, we make it mandatory ("m") and move it to appear after all fields, which have the order <5000 (defined order)  

	Example 2:
	hgf_920__l = -,m 
	-->We do not change the short description ("-"), which is defined in the default_form, but we make it mandatory ("m")

	Example 3:
	field (i.e. hgf_920__l) from the default_form has not to appear in the submission form of a specific document type:
	[document type]
	hgf_920__l = None

	Example 4:
	if a field (i.e. hgf_abstract, which is not in default_form) has to be added
	hgf_500__a = Abstract:,o  ("-" is not allowed)
	-->we set short description to "Abstract:" and make the field optional 
	WARNING: you can only add fields, which are defined under FIELDDESC!!! 	

-GSI configuration
-FZJ configuration
-RWTH configuration
-CERN configuration   

-FIELDDESC defines all submission fields
